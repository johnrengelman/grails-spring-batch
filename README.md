# GRAILS SPRING BATCH PLUGIN

This plugin adds the Spring Batch framework to a Grails project. It's intent is to minimize/eliminate the need for verbose XML files to configure Spring Batch jobs. 

## Getting Started

The Grails Spring Batch plugin is built using Grails 2.x, it currently has not been tested against Grails 1.3.x and will not install in those versions.

To install the plugin,
<pre><code>grails install plugin spring-batch</code></pre>

or add the following entry to your BuildConfig.groovy file in the plugins sections:
<pre><code>compile ':spring-batch:0.2.2'</code></pre>

Once the plugin is installed, you can define your Spring Batch job configuration in a Groovy script file in your application's grails-app/batch directory. The script's filename must end with BatchConfig (i.e. SimpleJobBatchConfig.groovy). Define your Spring Bach job using the Grails BeanBuilder syntax (just like in the resources.groovy file).

To launch a job from your application do the following:
1. Inject the Spring Batch Job Launcher and the job you defined in your configuration file into the controller or service (or lookup it up from the grailsApplication.mainContext)
2. Call the `jobLauncher.launch()` method with a reference to your job and a `JobParameters` object. Spring Batch will take care of the rest

grails-app/batch/SimpleJob.groovy
```
beans {
    xmlns batch:"http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch"

    batch.job(id: 'simpleJob') {
        batch.step(id: 'logStart') {
            batch.tasklet(ref: 'printStartMessage')
        }
    }

    printStartMessage(PrintStartMessageTasklet) { bean ->
        bean.autowire = "byName"
    }

}
```

grails-app/services/foo/FooService
```
class FooService {
   def jobLauncher
   def simpleJob

   public void launchFoo() {
      jobLauncher.launch(simpleJob, new JobParameters())
   }
}
```

## Supported Features

The plugin creates the following Spring Beans:
* jobRepository (JobRepositoryFactoryBean)
* jobLauncher (SimpleJobLauncher)
* jobExplorer (JobExplorerFactoryBean)
* jobRegistry (MapJobRegistry)
* jobRegistryPostProcessor (JobRegistryBeanPostProcessor)
* jobOperator (SimpleJobOperator)

These beans use the defined dataSource bean for your application and expected the Spring Batch tables to be available in this dataSource under and prefixed with "BATCH_".

The plugin provides the following scripts:
* CreateBatchTables - takes 1 argument that matches a supported DB for Spring Batch: db2, derby, h2, hsqldb, mysql, oracle10g, postgresql, sqlserver, sybase

## Configuration

The plugin expects your job configuration to be defined using the Grails BeanBuilder DSL in the grails-app/batch directory. End each configuration name with "BatchConfig" (i.e. JobBatchConfig.groovy). These groovy files will be copied into your classpath and imported. To use the Spring Batch namespace in your config file, declare the following:
<pre><code>xmlns batch:"http://www.springframework.org/schema/batch"</code></pre>
inside the beans {} closure.

## Sample Project

A sample / test project is included with the original plugin source, available at test/projects/spring-batch-test.  To get running, follow the instructions below:  

* Zip up the github repository, unzip it into directory called grails-spring-batch.  Then go into test/projects/spring-batch-test directory.  
* The default project uses h2, so run the command 
```    grails create-batch-tables h2
```

* After that start the application (grails run-app), you will find it at http://localhost:8080/spring-batch-test/
* Check db tables were created.  Go to dbconsole at http://localhost:8080/spring-batch-test/dbconsole/.  
   Substitute jdbc string to connect to the devDb: jdbc:h2:mem:devDb;MVCC=TRUE.
   Connect and make sure a bunch of tables that start with BATCH* exist.   All of the tables will have zero entries until the first run. 
* Run Included Simple Job.  Go to console, http://localhost:8080/spring-batch-test/console.  Type in or paste the following code into console window:  

```
    import org.springframework.batch.core.JobParameters

    simpleJob = ctx.simpleJob
    ctx.jobLauncher.run(simpleJob, new JobParameters());
```

After pressing execute, you can go to the application console (i.e. shell), and you should see text "Starting Job".  That means the batch job ran fine.  You can view the definition and modify at ROOT/test\projects\spring-batch-test\grails-app\batch\SimpleJobBatchConfig.groovy.

* See run record in the db.   Running select queries on batch tables will now show you information written about the run. 


## Versions

+ v.0.2.2 - Minor tweaks. Changed default table prefix to be upper case since that's what the Spring Batch library expects. Allow closure style config. Some package refactoring.
+ v.0.2.1 - Added jobOperator bean for use in UI, added JMX export, and loading of tables for in memory database
+ v.0.2 - Started over to make everything simplier. Define your configurations in the grails-app/batch folder in scripts named *BatchConfig.groovy. Use the groovy BeanBuilder syntax to define. The plugin provides jobLauncher, jobRepository, and jobExplorer for you.
+ v.0.1.1 - Minor update to include extra verification of tasklet, validator, incrementor, and jobListener artifacts.
+ v.0.1 - Support for SimpleJob, TaskletStep, Tasklet, JobParametersValidator, JobParametersIncrementor, JobExecutionListener.

## Feature Backlog

+ Auto-detect simple classes like listeners and policies and expose them automatically as beans.
